"AutoGen is a framework for simplifying the orchestration, optimization, and automation of LLM workflows. It offers customizable and conversable agents that leverage the strongest capabilities of the most advanced LLMs, like GPT-4, while addressing their limitations by integrating with humans and tools and having conversations between multiple agents via automated chat.

With AutoGen, building a complex multi-agent conversation system boils down to:. Defining a set of agents with specialized capabilities and roles.. Defining the interaction behavior between agents, i.e., what to reply when an agent receives messages from another agent.
